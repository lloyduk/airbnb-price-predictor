# airbnb-price-predictor
Developed a robust machine learning model that predicts rental prices based on multiple features like location, availability, and property details. Utilized Python with Pandas and scikit-learn to preprocess data and train the model, achieving strong predictive accuracy. This project demonstrates my ability to apply data science and ML concepts to real-world problems, optimizing pricing strategies for better decision-making
Some Features of this project include:
- Real-world Seattle Airbnb dataset 
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression model
- Custom price prediction for new listings

  Tools: Python, Google Colaboratory, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib
